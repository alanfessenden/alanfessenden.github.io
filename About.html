  <h1>About Alan</h1>

  <p>Alan Fessenden is a writer, actor, director, and creative consultant based in New York. His work lives in the intersection of comedy, intimacy, and the surreal—bridging performance, storytelling, and developmental support for other artists.</p>

  <p>He’s currently developing a trilogy of books—<em>Sweet Bunny</em>, <em>The Crystal Dragons</em>, and a third title still in progress—alongside new theatrical works and collaborative projects. His writing explores fractured relationships, constructed realities, and the mythologies we make to survive.</p>

  <p>As a performer and director, Alan has appeared on stages large and small, and is known for his sharp character work, sense of timing, and ability to shape space with humor and depth. As a consultant, he works with creatives across disciplines to refine narrative, sharpen intention, and move toward realization.</p>

  <p>This site is a window into his creative world. For projects, services, or just to say hi, feel free to <a href="mailto:alan@alanfessenden.com">get in touch</a>.</p>

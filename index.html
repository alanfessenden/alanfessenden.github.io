    <h1>Hi, I’m Alan Fessenden.</h1>

    <p>I’m a writer, actor, director, and creative consultant based in New York. I make work that’s funny, personal, and a little bit strange—from plays and books to podcasts and performance.</p>

    <p>You might know me from <em>Sweet Bunny</em>, The Fessenden Files podcast, or my work developing new shows and stories with other artists.</p>

    <p>Curious? Let’s talk.</p>

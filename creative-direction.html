    <h1>Creative Direction & Design</h1>
    <p><em>by Alan Fessenden</em></p>
    <p>I’ve always found myself at the beginning of things—launching theaters, shaping stories, sparking ideas into form. Whether it’s a stage, a space, or a script, I help bring meaning to the surface and draw people in.</p>
    <p>My creative direction lives at the intersection of performance, storytelling, and spatial design. From immersive installations and environmental builds to site-specific staging and visual storytelling, I approach every project with an artist’s eye and a director’s instinct.</p>
    <p>This is work that begins with listening—and grows into something beautiful, layered, and unforgettable.</p>

    <h2>What I Offer</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Creative Direction</strong> for art installations, immersive experiences, and spatial storytelling</li>
        <li><strong>Consulting & Concepting</strong> for brands, theater companies, events, or anyone in need of vision</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative Design</strong> of environments, interiors, and custom work that centers emotion, presence, and story</li>
        <li><strong>Performance-Based Installations</strong> that blur the line between the viewer and the work</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Past Work Includes</h2>
    <p>Designing the Chaudry Law Office with Priya Chaudry—a creative partnership that brought warmth, play, and a bit of wonder into a space often viewed as purely formal. The result is a law office that invites rather than intimidates.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Visually striking theatrical works for Jobsite Theater, Sun & Splendor Theater Company, and Group 120—where sets, light, and movement were as essential to the storytelling as the script itself.</p>
    <p>Personal art installations that explore memory, longing, and light—featuring mirrors, found objects, and layered emotional landscapes.</p>

    <h2>Let’s Build Something</h2>
    <p>Whether you’re looking for a creative collaborator, a director with an eye for space, or someone to bring a project to life from the ground up—I’d love to talk.</p>

          Alan Fessenden is an artist of many disciplines. Though trained in theatre performance, he emerged as a director and a creative force—often found at the beginnings of things, like founding Jobsite Theater and helping to open the Magnet Theater. He has worked across mediums and styles, often stepping into the void to build something new. His work has been bold, tender, and sometimes shaped by betrayal—but always his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alan was directed by Rachel Kavanagh (<em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em>), Joe Harmston, and Edward Hall (<em>The Winter’s Tale</em>) in the BRIT program at the University of South Florida. He studied clown with Giovanni Fusetti and trained in comedy with Kevin Allison, Kevin McDonald, Ed Herbstman, Abby Sher, Ian Roberts, and others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, his art is one of observation and exploration. The characters he writes are seekers—desperate for connection, for illumination, for home. His writing is haunted by memory but pushes forward in pursuit of beauty and belonging. He welcomes the dark as he chases the light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alan has always written—solo shows like <em>I Think I'm Dumb</em>, <em>What If I'm Dead?</em>, <em>Almost Perfect</em>; Christmas shows like <em>A Very Orphan Christmas</em>; and work with sketch teams. Only recently has he embraced the title of “writer,” stepping into larger projects like the <em>Sweet Bunny</em> trilogy.

          “The hint of dream like quality served me in one way. I was able to release fear with a quickness. When the surreal happens it becomes very important to flow with it. If I spent all my time trying to figure out how not to be a bunny, I would never have had the experience of living as a bunny. And now we were running again.”
